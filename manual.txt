Guide on how it worked on mac on dataset Osaka

-start with state of fdachs (2.1.22 13:13 - 969634c8)
-install liblinear - with make command in terminal
-add cython again (but no code changes in this direction)
-instead .at use _get_value() and _set_value(), respectively
-np.float-> float and np.int -> int
-pulp error: (look for executable file cbc and add file in find_ILP())
-now everything should go through

--Whats next:

1. start again but from the beginning and annotate really every change (
but make only the necessary changes -> as few as possible) (2 -vice)
    - how to report?

2. try with the other datasets (1)

3. task description - what else do we have to do?

4. Zwischenpresentation
    -5 slides
4. statistical testing

Data 0-3: mit default einstellungen durch

Data 4=Melb: tried but on ran_tran (NR. 366), runs on full load for 3.5h without improvement
â€”> for data 4 we choose to set time_limit of 15min/Traj:
